	description "Through merciless re-engineering and access to better-engineered materials, the ancient Grab-Strike has been heavily upgraded. The weapon uses more energy and runs much hotter, but fires at a vastly improved velocity and deals increased damage."

	description "Enhancements to the Banisher largely came down to greatly reducing the size of the weapon while retaining its power. The enhanced force of the beam has largely the same lackluster performance against shields, but can cause markedly improved hull damage over the base model."

	description "The warder was as already simple and compact a design as possible; enhancements could only be achieved with the enlargening of the weapon. Output, both by-shot and per-second, have been markedly increased, with a somewhat notable increase in resource usage."

	description "Enhancements to the repeater came in the form of an odd compromise; reducing the per-shot output of the weapon actually improved its overall performance by allowing the run to better regulate its heat output, greatly improving reliability while overall damage was still markedly improved."

	description "Two enhanced thermal repeaters mounted aboard a lighter, more optimized mount. Due to heat management concerns, the turreted repeaters do not retain the tighter burst grouping of their fixed counterparts, instead opting for slower bursts with reduced pauses between."

	description "Though the enhanced detainer sports minimal damage or fire rate improvement, it boasts a massive size reduction while retaining impressive power with improved velocity and range. A more refined tuning process also negates the chance the projectiles will cripple an ally's engines in its improved area of effect."

	description "This enhanced piercer launcher directly augments pre-existing piercers using built-in nanomachines. This results in a significantly increased power overhead, but the restructuring allows the missiles to fire both faster and further, with greater statistics both offensively and defensively. The modified launcher also boosts a far superior rate of fire."
	description "The improved launcher, however, is much larger than its pre-upgrade counterpart due to the necessary changes."
