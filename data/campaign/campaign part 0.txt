However, we have recently detected a very large fleet of Mereti activity; centered on <system>, where you currently are located. Join our force and repel the Mereti invasion; if all goes well, we will be able to remove them from the deepest reaches of our space.`

If you don't act quickly, the entire planet will become locked down by the Mereti swarm's mines. Using your executive authority as a subhive, you rally the ships on-world to prepare a defense, and broadcast a message to broader Sestor space requesting for aid.`

Additionally, our scouts have reported that the Mereti's grasp on Mesuket is slipping; thanks to your leadership, we are closer than ever to turning the tide of the war. Proceed to Sebra Skira in the Silikatakfar system when you're ready to another large battle: If all goes well, we will be able to push the Mereti back to Mesuket, where we may then begin to overtake their space."`
