However, we have recently detected a very large fleet of Mereti activity; centered on <system>, where you currently are located. Join our force and repel the Mereti invasion; if all goes well, we will be able to remove them from the deepest reaches of our space.`
			`Though you are a subhive, you still must obey the collective's direct orders. You prepare yourself for the coming battle.`

			`You can see the shadows of Mereti ships above the spaceport as you observe the state of the spaceport; already a minefield is being set up in orbit. If you don't act quickly, the entire planet will become locked down by the Mereti swarm's mines. Using your executive authority as a subhive, you rally the ships on-world to prepare a defense, and broadcast a message to broader Sestor space requesting for aid.`

			`You receive a message as you land back on Keneska Fek. The main Sestor hive greets you, "Well, Imperator, we must commend you on your quick thinking. Were it not for your fast actions, we may have faced a Mereti blockade the likes of which we have never dealt with before. Please accept a large resource allocation as well as an increment to your daily allowance; it seems your actions have had a crippling effect on not just the Mereti presence in Ferukistek, but in Eneremprukt as well."`
